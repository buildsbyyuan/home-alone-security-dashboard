# 🎄 Kevin’s Security System (K.A.I)
A Home Alone inspired AI dashboard  
Built at the Vibe Coding Hackathon  
By Yuan, Susanna, Daniel and Christo

## Overview  
Kevin’s Security System (K.A.I) is a playful AI powered dashboard inspired by the Home Alone films. Our team designed it as if Kevin built his own modern defence system to stay safe, stay organised and outsmart burglars.

The dashboard uses simple AI prompts, nostalgic visuals and childlike humour to bring Kevin’s world into a digital format. Everything was built in under 70 minutes during the Vibe Coding Hackathon.

## What We Built  

K.A.I is a small dashboard containing three core modules, each inspired by Kevin’s traps, tools and experiences from the films.

### 1. Trap Planner  
Interactive trap buttons with comedic AI generated explanations.

### 2. AI Survival Tips  
Users enter any situation and receive supportive, Home Alone themed survival advice.

### 3. Burglar Detector  
A fun input box where users type a name and receive a playful AI verdict of “safe visitor” or “possible burglar”.

All features were built using minimal code and fast AI prompting.

## Tools We Used  

We used beginner friendly tools including low code AI builders and rapid prototyping environments provided at the hackathon.

## Hackathon Timeline (68 minutes)  

- **6:32 to 6:40**  
  Roles, MVP and quick sketches.

- **6:40 to 6:55**  
  Core build and first panic.

- **6:55 to 7:10**  
  AI features and second panic.

- **7:10 to 7:25**  
  Polish and final fixes.

- **7:25 to 7:40**  
  Pitch prep and demo run (we were definitely still panicking).

This structure kept us focused on a small, achievable MVP.

## The Emotional Role: User Advocate  

We explored what Kevin feels when he is home alone.

**Key insights**  
- Fear of burglars  
- Feeling forgotten  
- Wanting independence  
- Needing reassurance  
- Wanting to feel clever and brave  

**This shaped**  
- Friendly, childlike language  
- Humorous tone that reduces fear  
- Bright visuals  
- Simple, confidence boosting interactions

## The Logical Role: Engineer / Problem Solver  

We defined a realistic MVP by asking:  
- What can we actually build in two hours  
- How to keep navigation simple for kids  
- Which features need only light AI interaction  

**We delivered**  
- A single clean dashboard home page  
- Three simple modules  
- A text input for AI features  
- Fully working interactions

## The Creative Role: Visionary  

We translated Kevin’s world into a digital design.

**Creative decisions**  
- Bright Christmas colours  
- Sketchy house map icons  
- Messy, energetic layout  
- Pixel or cartoon Kevin  

The outcome is a dashboard that feels like Kevin built it himself using crayons, Christmas decorations and chaotic imagination.
